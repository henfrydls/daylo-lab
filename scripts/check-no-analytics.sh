# Checks that whatever it is pointed at contains no analytics or telemetry code.
#
# It verifies two claims, and the privacy policy makes the same two in the same words:
#
#   1. The part of the app that draws the screen names no analytics, tracking or
#      error-reporting service, in its code, its dependencies or its built files.
#   2. The native part names no address other than the one src-tauri/src/checkin.rs sends
#      to. That file carries the check-in and, since 1.4, the answers to the question the
#      app asks once. Four kinds of message, one address: what this checks is the address,
#      because the address is what decides where anything goes.
#
# Until 1.3 there was one claim and it was shorter: nothing in this repository phones
# home. The check-in made that false on purpose, and a guard that keeps asserting
# something false is worse than no guard, because it goes green anyway once somebody
# widens a pattern to get their branch through. So the promise narrowed to something that
# is still true and still mechanical: exactly one file may name a host, it is
# src-tauri/src/checkin.rs, and the address in it is the one written here. A second URL
# in that file, or a changed one, fails — which is the part that matters, since that file
# is where an address would be changed if anyone wanted to send somewhere else.
#
# It lives in one place on purpose: both the CI of every pull request and the job that
# builds the demo call it, and if the pattern list were duplicated across the two
# workflows they would drift, leaving one of them guaranteeing less than it claims.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-no-analytics.sh [--text-only] <path> [path...]

# that file ever disagree, this script is what says so.

# Hosts data would be sent to. 'analytics' is scoped to a host context: without that, a
# comment saying "no analytics" anywhere in the code breaks the build, and in this
# repository that sentence is likely precisely because of what we are defending.
#
# The bare names carry \b for the same reason, and it is not theoretical: 'rollbar' with no
# boundaries matches inside 'scrollbar', so a 'scrollbar-width: thin' in any stylesheet
# turned every pull request red claiming the app has telemetry. The ones carrying a domain
# (plausible\.io, sentry\.io, amplitude\.com, segment\.(com|io)) are already anchored by the dot.
#
# Our own host is listed explicitly: 'analytics.henfrydls.com' does NOT match the generic
# pattern below, because there 'analytics' is a subdomain and the TLD comes after another
# label. Without this line, pasting the landing page's Umami tag into the app passed the
# check clean: the guard was blind to the one provider we actually use. deploy/build.sh in
# the website repository did list it, and that asymmetry between two lists written for the
# same purpose was the clue.

# '@opentelemetry/api' appears there as a peer of vitest, is not installed and never reaches
# the bundle. Searching for package names in the lock gives that false positive on day one.

# What actually covers the risk of an SDK arriving as a transitive dependency is searching
# for its HOSTS in dist/: package names disappear on minification because imports get

# bundle; if it is not used, there is no risk to cover.
