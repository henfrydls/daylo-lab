//! It is here and not in the webview for the reason that is also the point. The app's CSP
//! is `default-src 'none'` with `connect-src 'self' ipc: tauri:`, so the page can reach no
//! host at all, and anyone can check that in tauri.conf.json without trusting us. Nothing
//! checks the native side for them, so this file is short enough to read instead: one
//! address, four kinds of message, no retry, no queue, no state.
//!
//! Each kind is built by its own function with its keys written out, and each has a test
//! asserting exactly those keys and no others. That is the shape on purpose: a single
//! builder with optional fields would let a key appear in a message nobody meant to put it
//! in, and the promise this file carries is about what leaves, not about what was
//! intended.
