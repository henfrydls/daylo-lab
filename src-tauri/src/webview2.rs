//! Telling somebody their Windows is missing the piece Daylo draws itself with.
//!
//! Without the WebView2 runtime the app does not fail, it vanishes: the window never
//! opens, `run()` returns an error, `.expect` panics, and the release profile has no
//! console for the panic to reach. A person double clicks Daylo and nothing happens at
//! all, which is indistinguishable from an app that is simply broken.
//!
//! It has not mattered until now because the installer we publish downloads the runtime
//! while installing. The Store package cannot: an MSIX runs no installer of its own, and
//! the machines that still lack the runtime are exactly the ones that would find Daylo
//! there.

/// Whether the version string in the registry means the runtime is installed.
///
/// Microsoft's own instructions are to read `pv` under the runtime's client key and to
/// treat a missing key, an empty value and `0.0.0.0` as "not installed". The three cases
/// are why this is a function with a test rather than a truthiness check at the call
/// site: two of them are a key that exists.
///
/// Not behind a `cfg`, so it is compiled and tested everywhere. The registry and the
/// window below cannot be, and are the parts no test here can reach.
// Nothing calls it off Windows, and that is the point: it is the half of this file that
// a machine without Windows can still check.
