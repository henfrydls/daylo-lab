 * The letter the menu opens, already addressed and already started.

 * "Send feedback" is what opens it, and in a browser that entry is the only way in: the
 * band that used to invite people on its own is gone, and the question with stars that
 * replaced it in the app needs a platform a browser does not have.
 *
 * Three headings and nothing else: no version, no platform, no name, nothing the app
 * knows about the person. That is what lets the band say "nothing leaves your device
 * until you send the email" and mean it — the only thing that ever leaves is what
 * somebody typed and chose to send.
 *
 * Built rather than written out so the encoding is the language's and not mine, and
 * pinned by a test to the exact string, because a mail client that meets a stray
 * character shows the reader a body full of percent signs.

 *
 * The week is counted from the earliest of the first day this installation was opened and
 * the oldest record it holds. Somebody who restored a backup onto a new phone has lived
 * with Daylo for a year, and should not be treated as new because the handset is. The same
 * person is still not asked on their first day here, because that day they are setting a
 * phone up, not using the app.
 *
 * How many days the app was used no longer counts, and the history is the point. It asked
 * for fourteen calendar days and eight distinct days of use until 2026-09-23, then seven
 * and three, and since 2026-09-27 only the week. Each cut had the same reason: at the
 * usage the check-in can see, the gate was beyond where anybody had been. Of the fourteen
 * devices on the panel, four have had the chance to cross seven days and none did; the
 * other ten are younger than that and have no verdict yet.
 *
 * Dropping the days of use is not another loosening, it is a condition that was measuring
 * something the week already says: if seven days have passed between the first record and
 * today, that person came back. That is the whole question. One condition less to explain
 * and one less to get wrong.
 *
 * Worth saying plainly, because the paragraph above will outlive its numbers: the app does
 * not report whether this was ever shown, so what we know is who could have crossed and
 * did not, never who saw it.
