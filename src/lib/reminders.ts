 * builds with `Builder::new("notification")`, whose config type is the unit `()`, and
 * Tauri deserializes `plugins.notification` into that type while the app starts. A map
 * against a unit is an error, `.run()` turns it into an abort, and the app dies on the
 * first frame with "invalid type: map, expected unit" — which is what a phone did, twice.
 *
 * The per-notification field has no such problem: it goes through the same options object
 * as the title and the schedule, and Android resolves it against res/drawable. A bare
 * resource name is the only form that resolves; a path or an extension silently falls
 * back to the system's ic_dialog_info.

 * without it the alarm will not wake a dozing phone, and an evening reminder that waits
 * for the phone to be picked up is no reminder at all.
 *
 * What it does not buy is punctuality. Without SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM the alarm is an
 * inexact one, which Android is free to move within a window of about an hour, and
 * further than that out of a deep doze. Two deliveries measured on the same phone, a
 * Galaxy S24+ on Android 16:
 *
 *   set for 11:00, arrived 12:19 — 79 minutes late, phone asleep since the night before
 *   set for 19:00, arrived 19:00 — on time, phone in use
 *
 * Which is the behaviour the documentation describes rather than a fault: close when the
 * device is awake, stretched when it has not been. Asking for the exact-alarm permission
 * would fix the second case and is not worth it — it is the permission Android warns
 * about by name, for a notification nobody is waiting on to the minute. The wording in
 * the sheet says as much, so nobody has to discover it by being late.
 *
 * It will fire whether or not anything was logged that day. Suppressing it on a day
 * already logged would mean cancelling and re-arming from inside the app, and then a
 * person who does not open Daylo for three days stops being reminded on the days they
 * most need it. The wording is neutral for that reason.
