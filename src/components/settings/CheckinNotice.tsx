 * A new installation has it on, which is the owner's decision. What the code owes that
 * decision is that nobody finds out later: this appears on the first launch, before
 * anything has to be tapped, in the place the invitation to write uses, and it says the
 * state in its first three words. The way out is the same line.
 *
 * Somebody updating from an earlier version reads the other half. They installed Daylo
 * when it said it sent nothing anywhere, so the check-in stays off for them and the line
 * offers rather than warns. Both halves name the state in their first three words, and
 * for the same reason: a phone keeps those words and the link, and drops the sentence
 * between them, so a title that only said the name would leave "turn on" as the loudest
 * word on a screen where the check-in is off.
 *
 * A line and not a dialog, for the reason the invitation is one: a person opening their
 * calendar should not have to answer something first. The X closes it and changes
 * nothing about the check-in, which is the honest meaning of a cross.
