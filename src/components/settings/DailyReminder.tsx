 * Keeps the daily reminder in step with whether there is anything to be reminded about.
 *
 * Everything here follows from the same count. The offer is put once, and only after a
 * first habit exists, because asking on an empty app is asking about nothing; the alarm
 * comes down when the last habit goes, because a notification that outlives what it
 * reminds about is how an app gets uninstalled; and it comes back when a habit does.
 *
 * Both the accepted and the declined answer are recorded, so the question is never put
 * again. The setting in the menu is what somebody uses to change their mind.
