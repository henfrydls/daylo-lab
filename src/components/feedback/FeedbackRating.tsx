/**

 *
 * It replaced a `mailto:` link, and the reason is worth keeping because the link looked
 * like it worked. On Linux with no mail client configured, `xdg-open` exits zero without
 * opening anything, so the app said thank you for a letter nobody wrote and marked the
 * invitation as answered for good. On macOS the link opens the account setup assistant,
 * and on Android the compose activity ships disabled. A letter also asks somebody to
 * identify themselves one screen after the app promised it does not know who they are.
 *
 * In a browser the old link stays, and that is not an oversight left behind: a browser is
 * the one place a `mailto:` does work, usually against webmail, and the page has no
 * platform to send through anyway. The dialog is for the app; the link is for the web.
 *
 * A dialog and not a band, which contradicts the rule the rest of the app follows. That
 * was decided deliberately: the band it replaces had never once been answered, and a
 * question that can be scrolled past is a question that gets scrolled past.
 *
 * Two steps in one dialog rather than one screen with everything on it, and the reason is
 * a measurement and not a preference: with the stars, the box and the button together at
 * 360x740 the send button lands in the last pixels of the screen, underneath where a
 * phone on gesture navigation keeps its own bar.
