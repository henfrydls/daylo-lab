"""Did the app paint, and did its stylesheet reach the pixels?

Two different failures, two different answers.

A blank screen means the webview never loaded the frontend. That one a colour count
catches: a blank screen is one colour, two with a bar drawn across it.

A styled page and an unstyled one a colour count cannot tell apart at all, which was
measured rather than assumed: rendered at 1080x1770, Daylo has 2685 distinct colours with
its stylesheet and 2748 without it. The unstyled page has *more*, because the default
serif at default sizes antialiases into more shades than the app's own type does. Any
threshold that passes one passes the other.

What does tell them apart is a colour that can only come from the stylesheet. Daylo's
primary button is emerald, written as oklch and rendered #00bc7d. Styled, that tone
covers a couple of thousand pixels. Unstyled it is not on the screen at all: the button
is a grey system button. Measured on the same two renderings: 2275 pixels against 0, and
0 again on the real unstyled screenshot an emulator produced.

It also answers a question one step further in. A browser that knows @layer but not
oklch — Chromium 99 to 110 — lays the page out correctly and drops every colour
declaration. That page looks nearly right and is not: this check fails it.
